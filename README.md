# Filestack Swift SDK
<a href="https://www.filestack.com"><img src="https://www.filestack.com/docs/images/fs-logo-dark.svg" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="6"></a>
This is the official Swift SDK for Filestack - API and content management system that makes it easy to add powerful file uploading and transformation capabilities to any web or mobile application.

## Resources

* [Filestack](https://www.filestack.com)
* [Documentation](https://www.filestack.com/docs)
* [API Reference](https://filestack.github.io/filestack-swift/)

## Requirements

* Xcode 10.2+ (*Xcode 12+ required for SPM support*)
* Swift 4.2+ / Objective-C
* iOS 11.0+

## Installing

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```shell
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate FilestackSDK into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '11.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'FilestackSDK', '~> 2.8.0'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```shell
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```shell
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate FilestackSDK into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

`github "filestack/filestack-swift" ~> 2.8.0`

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `FilestackSDK.framework` into your Xcode project.

### Swift Package Manager

Add `https://github.com/filestack/filestack-swift.git` as a [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) dependency to your Xcode project.

Alternatively, if you are adding `FilestackSDK` to your own Swift Package, declare the dependency in your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/filestack/filestack-swift.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "2.8.0"))
]
```

### Manually

#### Embedded Framework

Open up Terminal, cd into your top-level project directory, and run the following command "if" your project is not initialized as a git repository:

```shell
$ git init
```

Add FilestackSDK and its dependencies as git submodules by running the following commands:

```shell
$ git submodule add https://github.com/filestack/filestack-swift.git
```

Open the new `filestack-swift` folder, and drag the `FilestackSDK.xcodeproj` into the Project Navigator of your application's Xcode project.

It should appear nested underneath your application's blue project icon. Whether it is above or below all the other Xcode groups does not matter.
Select the `FilestackSDK.xcodeproj` in the Project Navigator and verify the deployment target matches that of your application target.

Next, select your application project in the Project Navigator (blue project icon) to navigate to the target configuration window and select the application target under the "Targets" heading in the sidebar.

In the tab bar at the top of that window, open the "General" panel.

Click on the + button under the "Embedded Binaries" section and choose the `FilestackSDK.framework` for iOS.

## Usage

<details>
<summary>Integration into a Swift project</summary>

1. Import the framework into your code:

    ```swift
    import FilestackSDK
    ```

2. Instantiate a `Client` object by providing your API key and, optionally, a `Security` object:

    ```swift
    // Initialize a `Policy` with the expiry time and permissions you need.
    let oneDayInSeconds: TimeInterval = 60 * 60 * 24 // expires tomorrow
    let policy = Policy(// Set your expiry time (24 hours in our case)
                        expiry: Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: oneDayInSeconds),
                        // Set the permissions you want your policy to have
                        call: [.pick, .read, .store])

    // Initialize a `Security` object by providing a `Policy` object and your app secret.
    // You can find and/or enable your app secret in the Developer Portal.
    guard let security = try? Security(policy: policy, appSecret: "YOUR-APP-SECRET") else {
        return
    }

    // Initialize your `Client` object by passing a valid API key, and security options.
    let client = Client(apiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY", security: security)
    ```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Integration into an Objective-C project</summary>

1. Import the framework into your code:

    ```objective-c
    @import FilestackSDK;
    ```

2. Instantiate a `FSClient` object by providing your API key and, optionally, a `FSSecurity` object:

    ```objective-c
    // Initialize a `FSPolicy` object with the expiry time and permissions you need.
    NSTimeInterval oneDayInSeconds = 60 * 60 * 24; // expires tomorrow
    NSDate *expiryDate = [[NSDate alloc] initWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:oneDayInSeconds];
    FSPolicyCall permissions = FSPolicyCallPick | FSPolicyCallRead | FSPolicyCallStore;

    FSPolicy *policy = [[FSPolicy alloc] initWithExpiry:expiryDate
                                                   call:permissions];

    NSError *error;

    // Initialize a `Security` object by providing a `FSPolicy` object and your app secret.
    // You can find and/or enable your app secret in the Developer Portal.
    FSSecurity *security = [[FSSecurity alloc] initWithPolicy:policy
                                                    appSecret:@"YOUR-APP-SECRET"
                                                        error:&error];

    if (error != nil) {
        NSLog(@"Error instantiating policy object: %@", error.localizedDescription);
        return;
    }

    // Initialize your `Client` object by passing a valid API key, and security options.
    FSClient *client = [[FSClient alloc] initWithApiKey:@"YOUR-API-KEY"
                                               security:security];
    ```

<summary>Uploading files directly to a storage location</summary>

Both regular and Intelligent Ingestion uploads use the same API function available in the `Client` class. However, if your account has Intelligent Ingestion support enabled and you prefer using the regular uploading mechanism, you could disable it by setting the `useIntelligentIngestionIfAvailable` argument to `false` (see the relevant examples below.)

<details>
<summary>Swift Example</summary>

```swift
// Define upload options (see `UploadOptions` for all the available options)
// Here we use `.defaults` which implies:
// * preferIntelligentIngestion = true
// * startImmediately = true
// * deleteTemporaryFilesAfterUpload = false
// * storeOptions = StorageOptions(location: .s3, access: .private)
// * defaultPartUploadConcurrency = 5
// * defaultChunkUploadConcurrency = 8
// * chunkSize = 5mbs
let uploadOptions = UploadOptions.defaults
// For instance, if you don't want to use Intelligent Ingestion regardless of whether it is available:
uploadOptions.preferIntelligentIngestion = false
// You may also easily override the default store options:
uploadOptions.storeOptions = StorageOptions(// Store location (e.g. S3, Dropbox, Rackspace, Azure, Google Cloud Storage)
                                            location: .s3,
                                            // AWS Region for S3 (e.g. "us-east-1", "eu-west-1", "ap-northeast-1", etc.)
                                            region: "us-east-1",
                                            // The name of your S3 bucket
                                            container: "YOUR-S3-BUCKET",
                                            // Destination path in the store.
                                            // You may use a path to a folder (e.g. /public/) or,
                                            // alternatively a path containing a filename (e.g. /public/oncorhynchus.jpg).
                                            // When using a path to a folder, the uploaded file will be stored at that folder using a
                                            // filename derived from the original filename.
                                            // When using a path to a filename, the uploaded file will be stored at the given path
                                            // using the filename indicated in the path.

<summary>Enabling background upload support</summary>

New in version `2.3`, we added support for uploading files in a background session. In order to activate this feature, please do the following:

```swift
// Set `UploadService.shared.useBackgroundSession` to true to allow uploads in the background.
FilestackSDK.UploadService.shared.useBackgroundSession = true
```
